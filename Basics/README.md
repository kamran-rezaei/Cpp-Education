# Cpp-Education

## Basics  
This folder contains simple examples to learn the basics of C++ programming.  

---

### **hello_world.cpp**  
The classic "Hello, World!" program is a simple example to demonstrate:  
- How to use `cout` for printing output.  
- The basic structure of a C++ program.  

---

### **average_two_numbers.cpp**  
This program calculates the average of two numbers entered by the user.  

**How It Works:**  
- The program prompts the user to input two numbers.  
- It calculates the average using the formula: `average = (num1 + num2) / 2`.  

---

### **temperature_converter.cpp**  
This program converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.  

**Features:**  
- Convert **Celsius to Fahrenheit**.  
- Convert **Fahrenheit to Celsius**.  
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.  

**How It Works:**  
- The program asks the user to choose the type of conversion.  
- Depending on the choice, it performs the corresponding conversion using these formulas:  
  - Celsius to Fahrenheit: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`  
  - Fahrenheit to Celsius: `C = (F - 32) * 5/9`.  
- The result is displayed to the user.

### **calculator.cpp**  
This program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).  

**Features:**  
- Supports four basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  
- Handles division by zero gracefully.  

**How It Works:**  
- The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator.  
- Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding operation and displays the result.  

---

### **odd_or_even.cpp**  
This program checks whether a given number is **odd** or **even**.  

**How It Works:**  
- The program prompts the user to enter an integer.  
- It calculates the remainder of the number when divided by 2 (`%`).  
- Based on the remainder, it determines whether the number is **even** or **odd**.
